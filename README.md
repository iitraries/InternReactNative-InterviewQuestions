# React Native Android Intern – Interview Prep Questions

A curated, structured collection of interview questions specifically designed for React Native Android Developer Intern roles.

This repository focuses on what interviewers actually ask, not just theory — covering React Native fundamentals, Android awareness, performance, and behavioral questions, with an emphasis on practical understanding over memorization.

🎯 Who This Is For

- React Native developers preparing for Android-focused intern roles
- Students who know React Native but not native Android (Kotlin/Java)
- Candidates who want to sound aware, not clueless, in Android interviews
- Anyone aiming to maximize selection probability, not just pass technical rounds


Got it — you want the **README to explicitly match and reflect the current repo structure** you showed.
Below is a **tight, accurate README** aligned **exactly** to those folders and files.
No fluff, no mismatch.

You can replace your existing `README.md` with this.

## 📚 What Each Section Covers

### 🟢 Basic Android Awareness

Designed to answer one question:

> *“Can this React Native developer survive on Android?”*

Covers:

* Android lifecycle (Activity-level awareness)
* Permissions (runtime behavior)
* Hardware back button
* APK vs AAB
* Android OS fragmentation
* Android dev ecosystem basics (Android Studio, Gradle, Manifest)

⚠️ **No Kotlin / Java required**

---

### 🟢 React Native (Core Interview Focus)

#### 1️⃣ Core React Native Fundamentals

* React Native architecture (JS thread, UI thread, bridge)
* Core components (`View`, `Text`, `Image`, `FlatList`, `ScrollView`)
* Layout & styling (Flexbox, layout passes)
* React Native vs React DOM
* Expo vs CLI tradeoffs

---

#### 2️⃣ React (Hooks + State) — RN Specific

* Re-render mechanics
* `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`
* Memoization pitfalls
* Stale closures
* State placement & data flow

---

#### 3️⃣ Navigation & App Structure

* React Navigation (stack, tab, drawer)
* Screen lifecycle & focus behavior
* Passing params between screens
* `navigate` vs `push`
* Deep linking (awareness level)

---

#### 4️⃣ State Management

* Local vs global state decisions
* Context API strengths & limits
* Redux / lightweight stores (high-level)
* Async state & race conditions
* State ownership & unidirectional flow

---

#### 5️⃣ Networking & Async

* API → UI data flow
* `fetch` vs Axios
* Loading, error, retry states
* Race conditions
* Request cancellation & cleanup

---

### 🟢 HR Questions

Covers **non-technical rounds** commonly used for intern screening:

* Motivation & interest
* Learning mindset
* Project discussion
* Teamwork & communication
* Strengths, weaknesses, and closing questions

Includes **safe, intern-appropriate answers**.

---

## 🎯 How To Use This Repo

* Use it as a **checklist**, not a memorization sheet
* Practice **explaining answers out loud**
* Focus on **clarity and awareness**
* Ideal for:

  * Mock interviews
  * Last-week revision
  * Confidence building before interviews

---

## 🚫 What This Repo Is NOT

* ❌ Not a React Native tutorial
* ❌ Not Android native (Kotlin / Java) prep
* ❌ Not DSA / LeetCode focused
* ❌ Not framework API documentation

This is **interview-targeted preparation**.

---

## ⭐ Final Note

> Intern interviews don’t expect mastery.
> They expect **awareness, clarity, and growth potential**.

This repository is built to help you show exactly that.
