**Category purpose:** “Does this person actually understand RN or just acting up?”
## A. React Native Architecture & Render Flow

1. Explain the **full lifecycle** of what happens when a user taps a button that updates state and changes the UI in React Native.
2. What are the **JavaScript thread** and **UI thread** in React Native?  
    Why does blocking one of them cause visible issues?
3. What problem does the **Native Bridge** solve, and what are its **limitations**?
4. Why can heavy computations in JavaScript cause **frame drops**, even if native UI code is fast?
5. How does React Native ensure UI updates stay in sync with JavaScript logic?
6. What changes in the architecture when using **newer React Native architectures** (high-level, conceptual only)?

## B. Core Components (View, Text, Image, ScrollView, FlatList)

7. Why is **`View`** the fundamental building block in React Native instead of HTML-like elements?
8. What makes **`Text`** special compared to other components in React Native?
9. How does React Native handle **image rendering and scaling** across different screen densities?
10. When would using **`ScrollView`** be acceptable, and when would it become a serious performance problem?
11. Why is **`FlatList`** preferred over `ScrollView` for large lists?  
    What problem does it solve internally?
12. What is **virtualization** in `FlatList`, and why is it critical on mobile devices?
13. What are **keys** in lists, and how do incorrect keys affect rendering performance?

## C. Styling System & Layout Mechanics

14. React Native does not use CSS. So **how does layout actually work**?
15. Explain **Flexbox in React Native** and how it differs from web Flexbox (default directions, units, behavior).
16. What is a **layout pass**, and when does it happen?
17. How does React Native calculate sizes when you use **percentages vs fixed values**?
18. Why are there **no media queries**, and how is responsiveness handled instead?
19. What happens internally when a style prop changes — does it always trigger a full re-render?

## D. React Native vs React DOM (Web)

20. Why can’t React Native directly reuse **HTML, CSS, or the DOM**?
21. What does React Native render to on Android and iOS, compared to React on the web?
22. How is event handling different between React Native and React DOM?
23. Why does React Native performance depend more on **bridge traffic** than React DOM?
24. In what situations would React DOM be a **better choice** than React Native?

---

## E. Expo vs React Native CLI (Tradeoffs)

25. What problem does **Expo** solve for beginners?
26. What are the **limitations of Expo**, and when do teams eject from it?
27. How does **Expo’s managed workflow** differ conceptually from React Native CLI?
28. Why might a company prefer **React Native CLI** for production apps?
29. Can you build everything with Expo alone? Why or why not?

## F. Selection-Booster Conceptual Questions

30. If `FlatList` is more performant, **why does `ScrollView` still exist**?
31. How does React Native manage layout **without CSS files, selectors, or a browser engine**?
32. What are common **performance mistakes beginners make** in React Native without realizing it?
33. If an app feels laggy, how would you **reason about where the bottleneck is** (JS, UI, bridge)?
34. What aspects of React Native require **platform-specific thinking**, even though the code is shared?
